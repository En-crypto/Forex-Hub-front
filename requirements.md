## Vision 
 
 Our Idea came to handle the currency converting and make it easy to use and easy to read so you can easy decide the currency that you want to know the converting of it to another currency; also you can see a table for this currency and some information about it during the period you want .

 To be honest there is some difficult or tricking functionality that we use especially the function when we want to check if the user already exists or not. But all things now are fine.

 And about the goals of our project that as I told you that we just need to render the table about some currencies and the state of these currencies depends on the currency price during any period I want.
 And we want to make a converter for all currencies to another one.



## Scope

The web app will provide information to the users about information about all currencies.
The web app will provide converting and the state of the currencies
Users will be able to “Star” their favorite currencies.
the favorite page will contain reviews of the customer’s favorite currencies
 My web App will never turn into an IOS or Android app

 ## Stretch

 we will try to add a feature to see the chart about the relation between currencies depends on the time

## Non-Functional Requirements

Security : The profile page will be rendered only if the user is authenticated.
Usability: When the user sign up, his info will be stored on the database, so next time he sign in he will be considered as an already exist user.
